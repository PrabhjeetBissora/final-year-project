Problems


With Amadeus API, could not return list of irish airports. Possibly included in prod env, but not in test
 env which I was using for development
 
 
 curl -L -X GET 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location=-33.8670522%2C151.1957362&radius=1500&type=restaurant&keyword=cruise&key=AIzaSyBoPryoNFGz_SvBneuhkfgIcMI381f88fQ'

 
KEY: AIzaSyBoPryoNFGz_SvBneuhkfgIcMI381f88fQ
 
 curl -X POST -d '{
  "includedTypes": ["international_airport"],
  "maxResultCount": 1,
  "locationRestriction": {
    "circle": {
      "center": {
        "latitude": 51.87473,
        "longitude": -0.36833},
      "radius": 10000.0
    }
  }
}' \

-H "X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName" \

https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location=53.349805,-6.26031&radius=50000&type=airport&key=AIzaSyBoPryoNFGz_SvBneuhkfgIcMI381f88fQ

Why I struggled to find the right API:

(Amadeus API): Was not giving Irsh airports in Test Environment, but in Prod it was giving

mongodb+srv://admin:bissora@fyp-cluster.4q0pr.mongodb.net/








Which apis i need from amadeus:

The regex /(\d+)\s*(H|hour)/i is used to extract the number of hours from a time string. Let's break it down:

üîç Breakdown of /(\d+)\s*(H|hour)/i
/.../ ‚Üí Defines a regular expression.
(\d+)
\d+ ‚Üí Matches one or more digits (\d represents any number from 0-9).
() ‚Üí Capturing group, so the number (hours) is stored for later use.
\s*
\s* ‚Üí Matches zero or more whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.).
This ensures that whether there is a space ("1 hour") or not ("1H"), the match still works.
(H|hour)
Matches either "H" or "hour", meaning it works for both "1H" and "1 hour".
| (pipe) means "OR", so it checks for both "H" and "hour".
() ‚Üí Capturing group to match either "H" or "hour".
i (Case-Insensitive Flag)
The i flag makes the regex case-insensitive.
It will match "h", "H", "Hour", "hour", etc.
